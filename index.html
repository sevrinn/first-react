<!-- 
  Okay. Breaking this down for me to really understand.
  Line 8: Give ID attr to the element you want to be the component
  Lines 12 - 13: These are the scripts needed to include to use React
  Line 15: in our custom script we create a component with React.createElement() method that takes 
          the type of element we want to create (h1 in this example), {props}, and children ( in this case its a simple string)
          and we assign thhis component to the const App.
  Line 16: call ReactDOM.render, telling React to display our App component within the HTML element that has the id root
